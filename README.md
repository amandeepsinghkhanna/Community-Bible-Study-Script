# Python based bible study enabler:

This script starts from the first verse of Genesis, sends N(any number) verses per day, to a email until reaching the last verse of the book of Revelations.

I wrote this script to aid in community bible study. When scheduled by a scheduler this will send the selected versed once a day. 

I used a cron job to schedule it my rasberry pi to send an email with 10 verses everyday.
